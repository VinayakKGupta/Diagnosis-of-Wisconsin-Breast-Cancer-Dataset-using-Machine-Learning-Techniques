## Key findings ##

These projects were part of my university coursework and involved extensive discussions with peers and subject coordinators. I highly recommend reviewing the full report for a comprehensive analysis. In addition to the descriptive and diagnostic work done in Power BI, Python libraries such as Scikit-learn, NumPy, and Pandas were also employed to carry out advanced analyses. Techniques including voting classifiers, logistic regression, SVMs, and random forests were applied to extract predictive insights and strengthen the data-driven recommendations.
